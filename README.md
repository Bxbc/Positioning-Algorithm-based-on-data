# Positioning-Algorithm-based-on-data
## What in this repository
Since the Road test data based on the base station is very  confidential, I only upload the code without any data.
Although there is no data for view, you can find out how to extract data from .bin file and transfer them to readable bytes.
Moreover, how to store data in .csv file and use the coordinate of Latitude and Longitude to calculate the real distance
in map. 

Besides the earlier stage coding to deal with the raw data, there are some algorithms I used to realize the positioning algorithm. They are not the best, but hope can be help for you.
