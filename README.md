## What in this repository
Since the Road test data based on the base station is very  confidential, I only upload the code without any data.
Although there is no data for view, you can find out how extract data from .bin file and transfer them to readable bytes.
Moreover, how to store data in .csv file and use the coordinate of Latitude and Longitude to calculate the real distance
in map.
